The project code is divided into 4 parts:
	Part1.py for problem 1
	part2.py for problem 2 (tag0, tag1, tag2)
	part2_multipleTags.py for problem 2 multiple tags
	part3.py for problem 3

There are nor particular instructions to run the code.
Just follow the instructions printed on the screen and press 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 for chosing appropriate video:
i.e. o for Tag0 video
     1 for Tag1 video
     2 for Tag2 video
     3 for multipleTags video

Note:
- For part1.py, two output windows will open: one will show detected tag and one will show for corners for detected tag or original video.
- If the chosen video is multipletags, then the video window opens after 10 seconds usually after running the program.
